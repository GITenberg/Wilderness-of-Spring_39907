description: The time is the early eighteenth century, and two young brothers are
  the sole survivors of a brutal attack perpetrated on their New England village by
  the French. They eventually are reunited with some members of their extended family,
  but will the two boys be able to make their way in the world without the loving
  guidance of their parents? This detailed historical novel is a gripping, emotionally
  engaging read.
